## ⚛️ Atomic Commits

**Definition:** Keep each commit focused on a single thing.

**Benefits:**

- 🎯 **Clear purpose** - Each commit has one specific goal
- 🔍 **Easy to review** - Changes are logical and contained
- 🔄 **Simple to revert** - If issues arise, you can undo specific changes
- 📖 **Better history** - Project evolution is easier to understand

**Best Practice:**

```bash
# Good - Single focused change
git commit -m "fix: resolve login validation bug"

# Bad - Multiple unrelated changes
git commit -m "fix login, update styles, add new feature"
```

## 📊 Compact Commit History

**View condensed commit log:**

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This command shows each commit on a single line with just the commit hash and message.

## ✏️ Amending Commits

**Scenario:** You just made a commit and realized you forgot to include a file.

**Instead of creating a separate commit:**

```bash
git commit -m "some commit"
# Oops! Forgot to include a file
git add forgotten_file
git commit --amend
```

**What `--amend` does:**

- 🔄 **Replaces** the previous commit entirely
- 📝 **Updates** the commit message (if needed)
- ➕ **Includes** new staged changes
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Only use on commits that haven't been pushed!

## 💬 Commit Message Best Practices

**Present Tense vs Past Tense in `git commit -m ""`**

**Recommended:** Use **present tense** (imperative mood)

```bash
# ✅ Good - Present tense/Imperative
git commit -m "add user authentication feature"
git commit -m "fix navbar responsiveness issue"
git commit -m "update README with installation steps"

# ❌ Avoid - Past tense
git commit -m "added user authentication feature"
git commit -m "fixed navbar responsiveness issue"
```

**Why present tense?**

- 📏 **Consistency** with Git's own commit messages
- 🎯 **Describes what the commit does** when applied
- 🌍 **Industry standard** followed by most projects

⚠️ **Observation:** if the company uses **Past Tense**, use it!

## 🚫 Ignoring Files

**Purpose:** Tell Git which files and directories to ignore in a repository using a `.gitignore` file.

**Common files to ignore:**

- 🔐 **Secrets, API Keys, credentials** - Never commit sensitive information
- 💻 **Operating System files** - `.DS_Store` (macOS), `Thumbs.db` (Windows)
- 📋 **Log files** - Application logs, error logs
- 📦 **Dependencies and packages** - `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `__pycache__/`

**Example `.gitignore` file:**

```gitignore
# Secrets and credentials
.env
config/secrets.yml
*.key

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/
__pycache__/

# Logs
*.log
logs/
```

**Helpful Tool:**
🌐 **Create `.gitignore` for your project:** [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io)

## 🔧 Key Commands Summary

```bash
git log --oneline                    # View compact commit history
git commit --amend                   # Modify the most recent commit
git add .gitignore                   # Add gitignore file to repository
```

## 🌿 Branches & HEAD in Git

### What is a Branch?

A **branch** in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches let you work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase.

- 🏗️ **Main branch** (often called `main` or `master`) is the default branch.
- 🌱 **Feature branches** are used for new features, fixes, or experiments.
- 🔄 **Merging** brings changes from one branch into another.

### What is HEAD?

**HEAD** is a special pointer that always refers to your current branch and commit. When you make a new commit, HEAD moves forward automatically.

- 🎯 **HEAD** tells Git where you are working.
- 🔀 When you switch branches, HEAD moves to point to the new branch.

### 🔧 Common Branch Commands

**Create a new branch:**
```bash
git branch feature-branch
```

**Switch to a branch:**
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

**Create and switch in one step (recommended):**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

**List all branches:**
```bash
git branch
```

**See which branch HEAD is on:**
```bash
git status
```

**Switch back to main branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
```

> **Tip:** In newer versions of Git, you can use `git switch` instead of `git checkout` for changing branches:
```bash
git switch feature-branch         # Switch to branch
git switch -c new-branch          # Create and switch to new branch
```

**Visual Example:**

- `main` ← HEAD (current branch)
- `feature-branch` (another branch)

When you run `git checkout feature-branch`, HEAD moves to point to `feature-branch`.

### ⚡ Advanced Commit Options

**Commit with automatic staging:**

```bash
git commit -a -m "your commit message"
```

**What `-a` flag does:**
- 🔄 **Automatically stages** all modified tracked files
- ⏭️ **Skips** the `git add` step for existing files
- ⚠️ **Note:** Only works with files already tracked by Git (not new files)

### 🚨 Important Branch Workflow Rule

> ⚠️ **Always remember:** Commit your changes before switching branches!

**Why this matters:**
- 🔒 **Prevents data loss** - Uncommitted changes can be lost or mixed
- 🧹 **Keeps branches clean** - Each branch maintains its own state
- 🎯 **Avoids confusion** - Clear separation between different features

**Best Practice:**
```bash
git status                    # Check for uncommitted changes
git add .                     # Stage any changes
git commit -m "save work"     # Commit before switching
git switch other-branch       # Now safe to switch
```

### 🗑️ Deleting Branches

**Delete a branch (force delete):**

```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

**Important prerequisites:**
- ✅ **Switch to another branch first** - You cannot delete the branch you're currently on
- ⚠️ **Use `-D` carefully** - This force deletes even unmerged branches
- 🔍 **Alternative:** Use `-d` for safe delete (only merged branches)

**Safe workflow:**
```bash
git switch main               # Switch away from target branch
git branch -d feature-branch  # Safe delete (merged only)
git branch -D feature-branch  # Force delete (any branch)
```

### ✏️ Renaming Branches

**Rename the current branch:**

```bash
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

**Rename a different branch:**

```bash
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

**Common use cases:**
- 🏷️ **Fix typos** in branch names
- 📝 **Update naming convention** to match team standards
- 🎯 **Make names more descriptive** for better organization

**Example:**
```bash
git branch -m feature-login           # Rename current branch
git branch -m old-feature new-feature # Rename specific branch
```
