## 🎯 What is Git?

**Git** is a **version control system** that tracks and manages changes to files over time, allowing users to:
- ✅ Revisit earlier versions of files
- ✅ Compare changes between versions  
- ✅ Undo changes and restore previous states
- ✅ Collaborate with multiple developers
- ✅ Branch and merge code efficiently

### 📜 Brief History
In **2005**, **Linus Torvalds** (creator of Linux) became frustrated with available version control systems. They were:
- 🐌 **Slow** and inefficient
- 🔒 **Closed-source** and often paid
- ❌ **Limited** in functionality

He wanted a version control system that was **fast**, **free**, and **powerful**, so he created Git!

## 🐙 GitHub vs Git

### **Git** (Version Control System)
- 🔧 **Core tool** for tracking file changes
- 💻 **Local** repository management
- 🖥️ **Command-line** based (primarily)

### **GitHub** (Cloud Service)
- ☁️ **Hosts** Git repositories in the cloud
- 🤝 **Collaboration** platform for teams
- 🌐 **Web interface** for Git operations
- 📊 **Additional features:** Issues, pull requests, project management

## ⚔️ Command Line vs GUI Tools

### 🖥️ **Command Line Interface**

#### ✅ **Pros:**
- **Consistency:** Commands are always the same across systems
- **Power:** Advanced Git features only available via command line
- **Speed:** Much faster once you become comfortable
- **Documentation:** All online resources refer to command-line
- **Universal:** Works on any system with Git installed

#### ❌ **Cons:**
- **Learning Curve:** Not beginner-friendly
- **Memory:** Difficult to remember commands initially
- **Intimidating:** Terminal interface can feel overwhelming

### 🖱️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

#### ✅ **Pros:**
- **Visual Experience:** See changes and history graphically
- **User-Friendly:** Lower barrier of entry for beginners
- **Intuitive:** Point-and-click operations

#### ❌ **Cons:**
- **Inconsistency:** Interfaces vary across different GUI tools
- **Dependency:** Creates reliance on specific software
- **Limited Troubleshooting:** When things go wrong, hard to debug
- **Hidden Complexity:** "Magic" operations obscure Git's inner workings

## ⚙️ Basic Configuration

**Git Log** - Get information about all commits:

```bash
git log
```

**Check Configuration:**

```bash
git config user.name    # Check if you have a name registered
git config user.email   # Check if you have an email registered
```

**Set Global Configuration:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@gmail.com"
```

## 🔧 Basic Commands

**File Navigation:**

```bash
ls                           # List files and directories
ls -a                        # List all files (including hidden)
ls folder                    # List contents of specific folder
cd                           # Change directory
cd folder                    # Navigate to specific folder
cd ..                        # Go back one directory
pwd                          # Print working directory
clear                        # Clear terminal screen
open .                       # Open current directory (macOS)
start .                      # Open current directory (Windows)
```

**Git Operations:**

```bash
git status                   # Check repository status
git add .                    # Add all changes to staging
git commit -m "Your message" # Commit with message
git log                      # View commit history
```

**File & Directory Management:**

```bash
touch text.txt                           # Create single file
touch test.py app.java archive.pdf       # Create multiple files
touch Documents/documentation.docx       # Create file in specific path
mkdir Folder                             # Create single directory
mkdir car bikes                          # Create multiple directories
rm text.txt                             # Remove single file
rm text.txt test.py app.java            # Remove multiple files
rm -rf foldername                       # Remove directory and contents
```
